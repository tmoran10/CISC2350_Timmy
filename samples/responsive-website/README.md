# Responsive Website Sample
This website directory contains the HTML, CSS, and image files for a sample site.  There are comments in both the HTML and CSS that are meant to explain the changes that should be made when turning a non-responsive, desktop-only site into a mobile-friendly site.  By default, the site is loaded with the desktop-only version of the stylesheet [`style.css`](style.css).  The responsive version of the stylesheet [`style-responsive.css`](style-responsive.css) can be swapped in to see how this site would be optimized to work on multiple screen sizes.  There is also a [`style-responsive-notes.css`](style-responsive-notes.css) file that contains comments on all of the changes made to original, non-responsive stylesheet
