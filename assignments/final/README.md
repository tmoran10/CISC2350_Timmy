# Final Project
The final project will be your opportunity to create a website that ties together the skills we have learned throughout the semester.  You can choose to do your project on whatever you want, as long as it meets the requirements below. Because the prompt for the final is very loosely defined, be as creative as possible.  Don't just fulfill the basic requirements in order to get a decent grade.  Demonstrating that you have learned the skills discussed this semester *and* going above and beyond to make a stand out website will mean the difference between a `B-/B` and a `B+/A` :sparkle:

## Requirements
Below are the requirements for each aspect of the final project: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL.  For each of the below, your project must follow the good coding standards we have been practicing throughout the semester.

### HTML
- Semantically correct HTML.
- Valid and error free.
- Diverse use of different HTML elements.
- Properly formatted HTML code that follows the coding styleguide.
- At least one HTML form.

### CSS
- Valid and error free code.
- Diverse use of different CSS properties and selectors.
- Properly formatted CSS code that follows the coding styleguide.
- **Completely Responsive website**.  Your entire site should work on devices ranging from mobile to desktop sizes.

### PHP
- Valid and error free code for every page.
- Follows the variable and function naming guideline.
- Diverse use of variables and functions (user-defined and built-in).
- Sanitized and properly secured user input handling.
- Handle at least one form.
- Communicate with MySQL database.
- Properly formatted PHP code that follows the coding styleguide.

### MySQL
- Perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
- Perform operations within PHP code.
- Make sure data is properly sanitized and handled.
- Follow MySQL coding standards and best practices.

## General Requirements
- Submit a short proposal for the project you want to work on.  This is to get feedback before starting the project and know for sure that you will be able to meet the requirements.
- Website should have *at least* one page visible to the user.  This *does not* mean that you only need one file to complete the project, just that *at least* one page should be interactable and dynamic.
- Submitted to the `master` branch, in a `final` project folder to your `assignments` repo. Link to GitHub submitted to BlackBoard.
- Must give a short presentation on the day of the final to share your work with the class.  Presentations should last between 5 and 10 minutes.
	- Why did you create this project?
	- What were some of the challenges?
	- Was there anything that was particularly challenging?
	- What did you accomplish on this project that you are most proud of?
	- Short walkthrough of your working final project.
	- Take questions from the class.

:exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Because final project and course grades need to be submitted within a few days of our final exam period, **LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED**.  There will be NO exceptions without an acceptable explanation, proper notice, and something signed by someone important to convey the dire nature of your inability to submit the project on time.

## Project suggestions
If you can't come up with an idea for your final project, I suggest taking a crack at one of the below suggestions.  My advice for getting those creativity points is to look at an existing app/website/software that you enjoy and try to recreate a simpler version of it using the skills we've learned.

- To-do list: add, delete, update, view tasks.  Get creative by enabling multiple lists for different categories of tasks.
- Address book: create, delete, update, view contact information of people you know.
- Grade Book: add students and grades, calculate averages, provide weights to assignments/tests/projects.
- Book list (Like GoodReads): Keep track of books read or books to read.  Check them off after you've read them, create lists for different books.
- Grocery list
- Recipe book
