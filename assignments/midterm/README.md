# Midterm Project Prompt
For the midterm project, you will be creating your own resume/portfolio website.  This website will be a place for you to display your past experiences, skills, academic or proffesional acheivements, and any notable projects/papers/distinctions you would like to highlight.  You should design your website to reflect your current or future career paths while maintaining an overall professional feel.

## Project Requirements
The design of your website is completely up to you, and it is your objective to use the HTML and CSS concepts we've covered to bring that to life.  **The hard requirements for this midterm project are as follows.**

### HTML
- [ ] **AT LEAST 2 HTML FILES.**  One should be your main resume page, and the second is up to you (e.x. "About Me" page, portfolio of your projects, examples of work(s), published article/essay/paper you're proud of, etc.).
- [ ] Ability to navigate/link between the two HTML files.  Consider looking into the semantic `<nav>` HTML element and using `<a>` elements to link to the different pages.
- [ ] Use of structural elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- [ ] Use of container elements like `<div>` and `<span>`.
- [ ] At the very least, one image that you think best represents you as a professional.

### CSS
- [ ] A separate `.css` file that contains all of your styling.
- [ ] Support for print specific styling of your main resume page.
- [ ] At least 2 different fonts.
- [ ] Use of box model properties `padding`, `margin`, `border`.
- [ ] Use of dimension properties `width`, `height`, etc.
- [ ] Use of `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, or `hsl` color values - **no color keywords.**
- [ ] Diverse use layout and display properties `display`, `float`, and `position`.
- [ ] Diverse use of selector combinators.

### Directory Structure
You should have a specific file structure for this midterm project to house your HTML, CSS, images, and validation screen shots:
- [ ] HTML files should be in your main `midterm` directory.
- [ ] CSS files need to be in a `css` directory within your main folder.
- [ ] Any images you include should be be saved in an `img` directory within your main folder.
- [ ] Validation screenshots should be saved in a folder called `valid` within your main directory.

```
