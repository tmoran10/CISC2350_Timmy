#  Assignment 4
This assignment will be all about getting set up with our new, dedicated assignment repos and submitting a portion of your midterm project.

## Part 1:  Assignment Repo
From here on out, you will be submitting your assignments to a dedicated assignment repository - separate from the class repo we have been using.  [Follow the step-by-step instructions in the lecture notes](/notes/lecture5/1-AssignmentRepo.md) to step up a repo on your local computer, as well as a remote GitHub repo to push your changes to.  

**The deliverables for this assignment section are:**

1. A new *local* repository on your computer where you will be saving your assignments and work.
2. A new remote repository on GitHub where you will be pushing your local repository to.
3. Set up your repository to include every assignment we have completed until this point (1, 2, 3).
4. An assignment 4 folder in your new repo where you will be housing the second part of this assignment: the first draft of your midterm.

##  Part 2: Midterm first draft
Read over the midterm project prompt.  The second part of this assignment is to get a head start on your midterm and submit a first draft.

**This first draft will require the following:**

1. The markup (HTML) for *at least two files*.  The midterm requires that you have at least two separate HTML files for your resume/portfolio website.  You need to submit the HTML for these files.  **CSS FILES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION.**  However, if you'd like to get started on the styling, feel free to include them in your submission.
2. The appropriate file structure according to the midterm prompt (`img`  directory, `css` directory, `valid` directory).
3. Screenshots of your validated HTML files included in the `valid` directory.

This part doesn't have to be the final version of your HTML, but it will get at least half of the overall project effort completed so that you can focus on styling and finishing touches in the second week.

## Grading Breakdown
- 30pts for completing Part 1 (setting up your assignment repo).
- 70pts for completing Part 2 (HTML files, file strcuture, and validation).
