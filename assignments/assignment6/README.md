# Assignment 6
The purpose of this assignment is to get set up with your new MAMP development environment, and start out with some PHP.

## Part 1: Set up MAMP
Follow the lecture notes to download, install, and configure MAMP on your machine.  Make sure you are setting the MAMP document root to your desired file path.

## Part 2:  Getting started with PHP
Create an `index.php` file in your assignment6 folder (this should be set as your document root in MAMP).  In your `index.php` file create variables for your name, your birthday, 3 of your favorite foods, and 4 classes (this should sound familiar, think back to assignment1).  Make sure you are using semantically correct HTML for your file (e.x. Heading for your name, ordered list for the foods, etc.).

Assignment 6 must meet the following requirements:

- Created in and pushed to your `master` branch.
- File name `index.php`.
- AT LEAST 9 variables, one of which *must* be a constant.
- Variables must follow the variable naming guidelines.
- Display all variables on your page using **semantically correct, valid HTML**.
- No PHP errors.

## Grading Breakdown
* 20pts Error free page.
* 10pts valid, semantically correct HTML.
* 20pts adhere to variable guidelines
* 50pts create and include all variables in file.

**Please make sure you start the assignment early.  Give yourself enough time to ask for help and debug any errors or MAMP issues**

## Bonus
This week there is a chance to earn a few more points.  Visit https://pages.github.com/ and read up on what GitHub Pages are.  The TL;DR is it is a way to host a live website through a GitHub repo.

Make a Github Page that hosts your resume website.  Submit the link of your GitHub page (not the repo) along with your Assignment 6 link, and **earn +5pts** on Assignment 6.
