# Contributing to Projects on GitHub
One of the most powerful features of working on GitHub (and Git) is the collaboration functionality.  The two give us the ability to easily collaborate with other developers and contribute to projects in a streamlined and efficient manner.  GitHub has integrated features to track issues in a project's repository, propose changes to code, review and approve changes submitted by other developers, and merge changes made by other developers right into the project repository.  Below are some of the features of GitHub that make all of this possible.

## [Forking repositories](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
By forking a repository from GitHub, you're able to save an exact copy of that repository in your own account or on your local machine.  Forking is very useful for making changes to your forked version of the repository, and then submitting a proposal to include your own changes in the original repo.

## Branches
We've already discussed branches in a previous lecture.  Using branches we can make changes to a repository to create new features, bugfixes, or experiments without affecting our stable `master` branch.  Once we are ready to bring our new branch code into our stable `master` version, we can `merge` the two branches together.

## [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
A pull request allows you to present a change you created to a repository that you would like merged into the master branch (or some other branch).  This could either be a repository you forked from a project, or one that you are an official collaborator for.  Creating a pull request is basically like saying "I've made this change that I think could benefit the project as a whole.  Please review my changes and merge into the main project."  Pull requests (generally) should be created to merge one branch (with your proposed changes) into another branch (normally master or the main repo branch).

## [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
GitHub Issues is a ticketing system used for creating and keeping track of issues, bugs, future enhancements, or tasks for the repository.  An issue will include a description of the ticket with any relevant information, and can be commented on by other users to openly discuss the issue.  Issues and pull requests can also be tied to each other automatically in GitHub, as sometimes a pull request can be directly related to an open issue and vice versa.

## [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
Markdown is another type of markup language (like HTML) that has semantic meaning to its structures (headings, links, paragraphs, lists, etc.).  GitHub makes it easy to format your issues, pull request, comments, etc. using markdown to quickly include headings, links, lists, images, etc.

Now that we have some understanding of the different ways GitHub enables us to easily contribute to projects, have a look at this repositories [_contributing guide_](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see the guidelines for getting started on contributing.
