# Intro to PHP
[PHP](https://secure.php.net/) is the server side programming language we will be using for this course.  PHP is used to create dynamic web pages, and is often used with a database (we'll be using the MySQL database later on).  PHP is a very robust language, and was made to work quickly and easily with Apache and your choice of database.  PHP is used by some of the web tech leaders in the industry: Facebook, Yahoo, WikiPedia, etc.

## Your First PHP page
Let's take a look at a simple PHP page and break down the new bits.

```php
<!-- index.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>PHP Intro</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1><?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?></h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The important things to note about our first PHP page:

1. We still have HTML in our page.  PHP and HTML go hand in hand, and we can use PHP to dynamically change the HTML content that we want in our file.
2. Our file is saved with the `.php` extension instead of `.html`.  This is an important distinction - without the correct extension, you will not see the dynamic content generated by the PHP.
3. The `h1` tag contains some new PHP code.  When we view this in the web browser, our PHP code will dynamically generate the text "Hello, World" inside of the `h1` tag.

## Parsing the PHP
Now that we have our first PHP web page done, let's dig into how we were able to get PHP to say "hello".  The special tags you see `<?php ?>` are known as the [*PHP opening and closing tags*](http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php).  These tags indicate that there is PHP code in our file that should be parsed.  Any and all PHP code should go inside a pair of these opening and closing tags, otherwise the code will not be parsed.  You can have multiple `<?php ?>` tags throughout your file, and anything outside of the `<?php ?>` tags will be interpreted as plain HTML.

```php
<!-- index.php -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>PHP Intro</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1><?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?></h1>
	<h2>Welcome to <?php echo "PHP"; ?>.</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

You may have also notice the [`echo`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php) command used to place the text in our page.  The `echo` command prints whatever you provide it to the page.

## PHP Comments
Just like in HTML and CSS, PHP provides a way to include comments in your code.  Comments won't show up on your page when viewed in the browser.  They are for your eyes only.

```php
<?php
	// This is a single line comment

	# Another way to write single line comments

	/*
		This is a multiline comment. You can
		take up as many lines for your comment
		as you need.
	 */
?>
```

**NOTE** Make sure your are providing plenty of comments in your PHP code.  Now that we are getting into more advanced programming topics, I'll be checking your assignments for the regular use of comments.

## Important Language Notes
Here are a few things to note about your PHP code to always keep in mind:

1. Make sure your PHP file is saved with the `.php` extension.
2. PHP code needs to go in the opening and closing `<?php ?>` tags.
3. Most statements (lines) in PHP need to end with a `;` to let the PHP parser know that you are ending your line of code.  Without the trailing `;` you will see an error on your page, or the page won't render at all.

	```php
	<?php
		// ending this line with a semi-colon
		echo "Hello!";

		// this one too
		echo "Goodbye!";

		// pretty much every line
		echo "Just kidding, I'm back.";
	?>
	```
4. Whitespace is ignored by PHP.  Use this to organize your code in a readable manner.
